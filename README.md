# FEM in FeniCSx for fluid dynamics
This respoitory contains the .ipynb files i created for a project on solving PDEs assosiated with fluid dynamics using the finite element method. This have the objective of familiarizing with FeniCSx to then study the linear stability of a laminar and incompressible flow in tubes of arbitrary transverse section, reproduce and extend the current literature.
**Important**: The mayority of this code files are in raw and i will be updating them to better their comprehension.

Credits and recognition to my professor Federico Fuentes, lider of the proyect, and my colleges in the investigation Lucas Cayazo, Joaquín Meyer and Álvaro Toledo
